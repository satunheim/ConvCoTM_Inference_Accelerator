# TsetlinMachine_accelerator_image_classification
VHDL source code for an FPGA implementation of a Convolutional Coalesced Tsetlin Machine-based Image Classification Accelerator - Inference-Only.

The design represents the exact functionality of the ASIC reported in the paper "An All-digital 65-nm Tsetlin Machine Image Classification Accelerator with 8.6 nJ per MNIST Frame at 60.3k Frames per Second".

The preprint can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19347

The accelerator is implemented on a Xilinx/AMD ZCU104 development board.
